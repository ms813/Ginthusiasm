One minute it's a vibrant, deep blue hue... but pour over tonic and ABRACADABRA, your G&T is suddenly a beautiful dusky purple/pink colour. The 'magic' is due to the flower Clitoria Ternatea that colours Sharish Blue Gin without the use of artificial additives. The addition of tonic changes the pH levels and the varying shades depend on which tonic is used. Not to be outdone by its colour-changing properties, the gin itself is exceptionally smooth with a unique fruity aroma and citrus taste. Made in Portugal, the botanicals include Juniper, Cinnamon, Coriander Seeds, Clove, Vanilla, and, rather originally, totally fresh Orange Peel, Lemon Peel, Bravo Esmolfe Apple and Lemon verbena.",

The result: a highly distinctive, complex, floral gin with outstanding finish and impeccable provenance. In an age of re-badged industrial gins, the Botanist stands out as a truly artisanal, small-batch, hand-crafted labour of love and distiller's art. A breath of botanical Islay in every glass.\n\nBODY\nThe spirit is satin smooth gliding over the palate like no gin you have ever tried before. A totally seductive experience.\n\nNOSE\nThe aromas explode like an olfactory Aurora Borealis, filling the senses with meteorites of smell sensations as they explode from the glass. Sweet delicate menthol, apple mint, spring woodlands, juniper, coriander with aniseed undertones, lemon and orange peel, a bouquet of summer flowers on the Machir, honey from thistle, coconut from gorse, wild mint and summer meadows. It's a magical melody of Islay's natural bounty from the Atlantic washed beaches to the summit of heather covered hills. Inhale and you're there on the queen of the Hebrides!\n\nPALATE\nThe taste is rich and mellow; cool on entry then as it reaches the back palate you can feel the warmth and absolute purity of slow unhurried distillation. This is a bewitching, delectable and luxurious gin; its citrus freshness excites and stimulates the taste buds allowing you to experience a star-burst of flavours as they explode across the palate.\n\nFINISH\nAll this from a beaten up old pot still, operated by beaten up distillers on the coast of heaven.\n\nMOOD\nCarefree.

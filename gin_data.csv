Sharish Blue Magic Gin,40,"Sharish Blue Magic Gin really is magical. One minute it's a vibrant, deep blue hue... but pour over tonic and ABRACADABRA, your G&T is suddenly a beautiful dusky purple/pink colour. The 'magic' is due to the flower Clitoria Ternatea that colours Sharish Blue Gin without the use of artificial additives. The addition of tonic changes the pH levels and the varying shades depend on which tonic is used. Not to be outdone by its colour-changing properties, the gin itself is exceptionally smooth with a unique fruity aroma and citrus taste. Made in Portugal, the botanicals include Juniper, Cinnamon, Coriander Seeds, Clove, Vanilla, and, rather originally, totally fresh Orange Peel, Lemon Peel, Bravo Esmolfe Apple and Lemon verbena.",,40,gins/sharish-blue-magic.jpg,Sharish Gin,"juniper, cinnamon, coriander, clove, vanilla, orange peel, lemon peel, apple, lemon verbena"

The Botanist Islay Dry Gin,35,"The Botanist Gin is a progressive exploration of the botanical heritage of our Isle of Islay. 22 hand-foraged local botanicals delicately augment nine berries, barks, seeds and peels during an achingly slow distillation. This first and only Islay Dry Gin is a rare expression of the heart and soul of our remote Scottish island home.","For this, 'The Botanist', small-batch, artisanal Islay gin we use nine of the classic gin aromatics - orris root, cassia bark, coriander seed, etc - and augment these with a heady harvest of 22 local botanicals, hand-picked by our expert foraging team from the windswept hills, peat bogs and Atlantic shores of this Hebridean island of Islay.

This truly seasonal and exotic SERVE is then slow simmer distilled in our unique and cherished Lomond pot-still, affectionately known by our former head distiller Jim McEwan as 'Ugly Betty'.

Betty prefers to work at low-pressure and won't be rushed. So our precious botanicals are slowly and gently coaxed into releasing their complex, signature aromatics.

From that first, achingly-slow 17 hour distillation. The result: a highly distinctive, complex, floral gin with outstanding finish and impeccable provenance. In an age of re-badged industrial gins, the Botanist stands out as a truly artisanal, small-batch, hand-crafted labour of love and distiller's art. A breath of botanical Islay in every glass.

PALATE

Original gin has a very clean and sweet taste. Very smooth and soft on the tongue. Delivers spices of juniper and green pepper followed by bitter drying berries of cranberry and seabuckthorn.

Eden gin leaves a slight prickle on the back of the tongue from the juniper and correander that moves to leave a sweet orangey/lychee note. This quickly vanishes leaving you wanting more.

Original gin brings out the citrus orange freshness of the gin which becomes mellow and delicate with lychee and pear becoming evermore present.

   "long_description": "Dr. Copperhead was a notorious alchemist, in search of the elixir of life. During his pursuit he surprisingly found an exquisite composition: a copper distilled gin recipe based on five essential botanicals: angelica, juniper, cardamom, orange peel and coriander seed. Copperhead gin is a gentle and versatile gin which can be mixed by meticulously elaborated blends with a functional component such as Aperitivum, Energeticum and Digestivum. In this way one can choose the effect of his gin: appetizing, energizing or digestive. ",

The only facility to survive the Axis bombing, now known as \"Old Tom,\" has since been moved to Cameron Bridge, Scotland.",

   "long_description": "The Botanist is an artisanal Islay gin made by Bruichladdich Distillery. It is the only gin made on Islay and is distinctive for its augmentation of the nine classical gin aromatics with a further 22 locally picked wild Islay botanicals. It is these botanicals – and the two local botanists who collect them – that inspire its name. The Botanist is slow distilled in “Ugly Betty”, a Lomond Still, one of the last in existence. The distillation takes seventeen hours, distilling at 0.2 atmospheres of pressure, four times longer than an average whisky distillation. The gin is distilled after an overnight maceration of the nine base botanicals - the seed, berry, bark, root and peel categories - in spirit and Islay spring water. This alcohol vapour infusion from the distillation then passes through the botanical basket containing the 22 more delicate Islay aromatic leaves and petals. It is this double infusion that gives the Botanist gin its distinctive flavour, allowing the more delicate aromatic leaves and petals to influence the gin vapour without being destroyed.\n\n",

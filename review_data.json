I was so genuinely disappointed. I have been collecting craft gins now for a while and this one had to go. I couldn't even get my fellow gin lovers to like it so I could give it away. I hate to leave a negative review but seems plenty of you out there love the stuff and that's cool by me. I won't recommend this gin. I am truly sorry. It's tsomething you give to people who you need to vomit, and very quickly. That said, I know I'm not alone because there's a few reviews on other sites and such where others feel the same way I do.

The taste is very different to what else is on the market, and while it sounds like a busy mix of ingredients, its not too powerful or overwhelming and the taste is very balanced indeed. If you add a mixer the taste expands even further to include the citrus, bergamot, as well as hints of cinnamon, clove and saffron, which again are not too overwhelming but add a nice twist to the traditional gin taste.",

It compares very favourably with gins that cost significantly more.",

UserProfile.EXPERT,2016-03-23,3,"This gin is pleasant but a little on the light side for me. For me it does not offer a better botanical flavour than others or a better standard dry gin taste, and therefore I don't think it is one I would buy regularly.

UserProfile.EXPERT,2016-02-20,4,"Superb gin based on a historic recipe and process. It's not subtle. It has an overpowering juniper fragrance and flavour.

UserProfile.ADMIN,2016-10-19,1,"I ordered this gin based on reviews found on various websites. I received it today and sadly, the first sip hit my gag reflex and then I had no option but to pour it down the drain. I'm a gin snob, so to speak, but on first sip my mouth quickly picked up a very dominating flavor mix of cinnamon or cardamon everything from there slid right down the hill. I was so genuinely disappointed. I have been collecting craft gins now for a while and this one had to go. I couldn't even get my fellow gin lovers to like it so I could give it away. I hate to leave a negative review but seems plenty of you out there love the stuff and that's cool by me. I won't recommend this gin. I am truly sorry. It's tsomething you give to people who you need to vomit, and very quickly. That said, I know I'm not alone because there's a few reviews on other sites and such where others feel the same way I do. This reminds me it's just a personal thing, and I'm not alone.",53.42345186,-1.069273926,Rozz,Sharish Blue Magic Gin,DN11 8HY

UserProfile.EXPERT,2017-01-14,4,"I buy gin by value and simplicity: the complex ones with multiple botanicals leave me cold, because if you add too many one cancels out another and you end up with a compromise.

This gin works well with a splash of Angostura and a lot of ice, plus supermarket tonic. (No need for an overdraft and Fever Tree.)

UserProfile.ADMIN,2016-11-04,5,"Having tasted a lot of gins over the years I was pleasantly surprised to find this one was smoother than most and dry without being overly bitter. It was a delight with tonic and bitter lemon, in fact that sort of became the problem - we didn't notice how quickly we were drinking it because it was so nice!",51.3359127,-0.437876617,Rozz,Gordon's London Dry Gin,KT11 1DS
UserProfile.BASIC,2017-03-13,4,"I have something of a gin habit and rather geekily score gins for both gin and tonics and martinis on a spreadsheet (I mix with a twist of lemon, well I don't mix it myself thats what husbands are for). I score out of ten and I give my go to gin (Bombay London) a 5 out of 10 to act as a baseline to judge against. We score more than once so I get an idea of how they taste over different times and occasions. Please remember these scores are personal and what I like you might not.",59.87261549,-1.306772112,Sharon,Eden Mill Hop Gin,ZE3 9JT

UserProfile.BASIC,2016-05-24,1,"I can't see what the fuss is about. To me it tastes slightly sweeter, which I am not sure I like. I think in future I will stick with my no frills London Dry Gin and splash out on Bombay Sapphire or Sipsmith on special occasions.",54.65758816,-2.737007776,Bob,Tanqueray Rangpur Gin,CA10 2AX

UserProfile.EXPERT,2016-08-11,4,"Cosmetic impressions are good. The bottle is just beautiful, like a shard of green crystal straight out of the 1920s. There is a minimal label to spoil the effect. It feels good in the hand, if easy to hold and pour. I even like the knurled effect on the lid. It reeks of quality.",51.390611,-2.177471,Hector,Tanqueray No. Ten Gin,SN12 8EZ
UserProfile.EXPERT,2016-08-14,4,Big hit of citrus with this one so choose your accompaniment carefully. Very different to your typical (juniper flavored) gin and good for cocktails where a citrus hit can be appreciated.,51.38268061,-2.143413935,Alice,Tanqueray Rangpur Gin,SN12 8FB
UserProfile.EXPERT,2016-09-07,4,"I had high hopes for this gin based on other reviews, but I was left a little disappointed. Don't get me wrong, this is a good gin, but no better than Bombay Sapphire or other mid-range gins. Spend a little extra and buy Blackwoods 60% gin.",51.38196969,-2.143885889,Hector,Eden Mill Love Gin,SN12 8FD
UserProfile.EXPERT,2016-09-21,3,"This isn't a harsh drink, it tastes quite floral and quite sweet. This maybe limits the mixing ability, for example - when mixed with elderflower cordial it seemed a bit too sweet. The natural sweetness and delicate flavour means that it makes a nice shot or short with ice.",51.38245545,-2.143714984,Hector,Gordon's London Dry Gin,SN12 8FE
UserProfile.BASIC,2016-12-09,2,Great taste quick delivery. It's our second bottle. Will buy again for birthdays.,51.41457279,-1.520573088,Sharon,Isle of Harris Gin,RG17 0JE
UserProfile.BASIC,2016-12-12,1,I bought this having read the excellent reviews that had been posted. I was interested to try it when I realised it was from the Bruichladdich distillery. It boasts 22 botanicals. Sadly none of these give enough flavour or aroma. Glad I have tried it but I won't be buying another bottle.,51.41128213,-1.525064779,Sharon,The Botanist Islay Dry Gin,RG17 0JF
UserProfile.BASIC,2016-12-13,5,"Absolutely my favourite gin by a mile! Lovely flavours and goes down smoothly (and a little too easily) when paired with Fentimans tonic and a slice of lime. Of all the gins I've tried (and that's becoming rather a lot), this is by far the nicest.",52.03560625,-0.36053924,Bob,The Botanist Islay Dry Gin,SG17 9SG

UserProfile.ADMIN,2016-03-30,4,"I initially tried this neat and it had a bit of a kick on the back end but was smooth up front and had a fresh smell and taste. After a few sips neat I decided to add some apple juice to the glass and this was a very nice combination, became very easy to sup.",51.545851,0.098107586,Robert,Gordon's London Dry Gin,IG11 9DS
UserProfile.ADMIN,2016-04-28,4,"This was a gift for my father, a retired distiller and an avid gin drinker, and one not given to blind complements. It was the latest in a series of boutique gins I have bought for him and the first to receive highly enthusiastic feedback. To any that know him that is praise indeed!",51.54689447,0.098475838,Rozz,Gordon's Crisp Cucumber,IG11 9DU
UserProfile.EXPERT,2016-05-29,5,"The botanicals blend is very different from the reserve blend produced by Gordon's, as it has a mixture of juniper, coriander, citrus and oriental spices as well as a traditional gin mix. The taste is very different to what else is on the market, and while it sounds like a busy mix of ingredients, its not too powerful or overwhelming and the taste is very balanced indeed. If you add a mixer the taste expands even further to include the citrus, bergamot, as well as hints of cinnamon, clove and saffron, which again are not too overwhelming but add a nice twist to the traditional gin taste.",51.5484889,0.102342631,Alice,Gordon's Sloe Gin,IG11 9DY
UserProfile.EXPERT,2016-06-15,5,"Complex, yet delicate, smooth and almost flowery, this gin is truly magnificent.",51.54895771,0.104282612,Hector,Isle of Harris Gin,IG11 9DZ
UserProfile.EXPERT,2016-07-08,5,"As a bar owner with a particular affinity for gins, I had heard about this offering prior to it winning a Gold rating at the annual industry awards. Upon trying it, the experience received was a very balanced citrus base with fresh spice notes. I'd recommend this combined with a good quality tonic water over ice, with fresh lime or cucumber, where the result is outstanding. It compares very favourably with gins that cost significantly more.",51.54905975,0.107114394,Hector,Eden Mill Original Gin,IG11 9EB
UserProfile.EXPERT,2016-08-01,5,"Delicious. If you buy ANY gin, buy this one. Much better than Gordon's Gin.",55.82737253,-4.404580818,Alice,Eden Mill Hop Gin,PA2 7DB
